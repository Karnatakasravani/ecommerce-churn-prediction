\# Business Problem



\## Project Title

E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction



\## Background

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based and e-commerce businesses.

Retaining an existing customer is significantly cheaper than acquiring a new one.



The company currently has \*\*no systematic way to identify customers who are likely to churn\*\*.

As a result, the business loses revenue that could otherwise be protected through timely engagement.



\## Business Question

Can we build a machine learning model that predicts which customers are at risk of churn so the business can proactively retain them?



\## Stakeholders

\- Business Leadership

\- Marketing / CRM Team

\- Data Team

\- Customer Support Team



\## Business Goals

\- Identify at-risk customers before they leave

\- Enable targeted retention campaigns

\- Improve customer lifetime value (CLV)

\- Reduce churn-related revenue loss



\## Impact of Churn

\- Loss of recurring revenue

\- Increased acquisition costs

\- Negative word-of-mouth

\- Lower lifetime value



\## Problem Statement

We need a data-driven churn prediction system that flags customers with high churn probability so the marketing team can take proactive action.
