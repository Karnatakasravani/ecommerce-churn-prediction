🌟 Key Achievements



Built a complete end-to-end ML pipeline from raw data to deployed model



Successfully deployed a live Streamlit application for churn prediction



Designed meaningful customer-behavior features improving model accuracy



🧠 Challenges Overcome



Challenge: Handling missing CustomerID and cleaning noisy transaction data

Solution:



* Removed rows with missing customer IDs



* Filtered invalid/negative quantities



* Ensured chronological order for churn labeling



Learning:

I learned the importance of clean data and consistent time-based logic when defining churn.



🔍 Areas for Improvement



Could experiment with more model tuning \& explainability



Would like to automate pipeline execution



Could improve UI further for production-style usage
